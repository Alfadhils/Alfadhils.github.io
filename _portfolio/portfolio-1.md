This portfolio contains projects completed as part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program offered by Udacity in collaboration with AWS. The nanodegree focuses on developing foundational AI programming skills using Python and explores various aspects of machine learning and deep learning. We develop a CLI machine learning application using PyTorch to perform preprocessing, training, and inference. There are two main projects associated with this program :
1. Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds
2. Create Your Own Image Classifier
