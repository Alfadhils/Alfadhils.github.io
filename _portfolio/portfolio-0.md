Over the course of six intensive months, I immersed myself in a comprehensive AWS training program that blended theory with hands-on experience. I participated in more than 70 days of structured onsite training focused on real-world cloud solutions and best practices. In parallel, I dedicated over 100 hours to self-paced learning through AWS Skill Builder, exploring advanced topics and completing labs that deepened my technical understanding.

This journey was not just about consuming content—it was about transforming how I approach cloud-based problem solving. As a result, I earned several industry-recognized certifications, including the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** and the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**, both with scores above 850. I also achieved the **AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty**, scoring above 800, which reflects my strong foundation in applying machine learning techniques within the AWS ecosystem.

Beyond certifications, I pushed further to earn **8 AWS Knowledge Badges** and complete all **8 Cloud Quest Badges**, each designed to simulate real-world scenarios in roles like Solutions Architect, Serverless Developer, and Machine Learning Specialist. These milestones collectively represent not just credentials, but a journey of growth and a commitment to mastering cloud technology from the ground up.
