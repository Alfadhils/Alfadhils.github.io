This repository contains the codebase for the optimization of the Biomass Supply Chain (BSC) system, as presented in the thesis titled "Optimizing the Long-term Biomass Supply Chain: A Deep Learning and Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach."

Optimizing the Long-term Biomass Supply Chain: A Deep Learning and Mixed Integer Linear Programming Approach
======

This thesis introduces a comprehensive case study focused on optimizing the long-term Biomass Supply Chain (BSC) system. The proposed methodology consists of two key phases:

1. Predictive Modeling with Deep Learning:
  - Development of a predictive model for forecasting biomass availability.
  - Utilization of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to handle the Spatio-Temporal (ST) nature of the data.

2. Facility Location Problem with MILP:
  - Formulation of a Facility Location Problem model.
  - Deployment of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to optimize facility location-allocation and minimize costs.

The primary objective is to establish a framework for realizing the BSC system in a given region, leveraging advanced DL and MILP methods. This approach aims to reduce dependence on Geographical Information Systems (GIS), addressing the associated challenges of expertise and high costs.
