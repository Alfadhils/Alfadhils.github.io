A modern web-based system to streamline and secure change request management, reducing risk in critical environments like financial services.

## Change Advisory Board Application

**Change Advisory Board Application** is a solo-developed solution designed to modernize change request management within the company. Built to support organizations in highly regulated industries such as **financial services**, this application helps reduce operational risks associated with system and infrastructure changes.

As the sole developer, I handled both **frontend** and **backend** development, as well as system design and deployment strategy. The application was designed with a **three-tier architecture** to ensure maintainability and scalability.

### üîß Tech Stack
- **Architecture**: Three-tier web application  
- **Backend**: Express.js  
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React + TypeScript)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  

### üåü Key Features
- **Real-Time Change Request Monitoring**  
- **Change Request Input, Tracking & Record Keeping**  
- **Cross-Division Integration**

This application enhances visibility and accountability in the change request process, contributing to **reduced risk and improved compliance**.
