## Credit Line Management System (CLMS)

**Credit Line Management System (CLMS)** is an award-winning solution developed as part of the final project for ITDP 2 at Bank BJB.

As both **Project Manager** and **Backend Developer**, I led a team of two peers handling frontend development, business analysis, and UI/UX design. I was responsible for strategic and technical decisions, including defining the tech stack, system architecture, and core feature set.
