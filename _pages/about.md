IT Cloud Architect and ML/Gen AI Specialist

About Me
===

I am an IT Architect at bank **bjb**, with a background in Electrical Engineering from the University of Indonesia, graduated in just 3.5 years with **cum laude** distinction. In my role, I am responsible for initiatives in Emerging Technology **Research & Development**, **Cloud Architecture and Migration**, as well as Enterprise **System Modernization**—all while ensuring **compliance** with the strict regulatory standards of the financial services industry.

My professional journey at bank **bjb** began in 2024 through the prestigious IT Future Leader Development Program. During this program, I honed both technical and leadership skills, emerging as the **second-highest scoring graduate**. I was also honored with the **Best Final Project Team Award** for developing the Credit Line Management System (CLMS), a solution designed to reduce operational risk through digitalization, integration, and automation.

I bring a multifaceted skill set in **Cloud Computing** (especially on AWS), **Data and AI**, and **Full-Stack Development**. My capabilities are validated through globally recognized certifications such as **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate** and **AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer – Associate**. I am also a recipient of **Advanced ML/AI Scholarship** from AWS, reflecting both my technical depth and commitment to lifelong learning.

I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where autonomy, impact, and quality are valued. I’m always eager to take on new challenges, explore innovative ideas, and deliver solutions that make a measurable difference.
